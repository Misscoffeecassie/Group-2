 * An extra is the same comparison with the Potential attribute for the line-up instead of the Overall attribute.

 * Sample analysis of top 5% of the players to see if some important attributes have been important or not across the FIFA dataset e.g. are the top 5% players of FIFA 21 faster (higher Acceleration and Agility) compared to FIFA 17.  
 * The trend of attributes is also an important indication of how some attributes are necessary for players to win games e.g. if top 5% players have higher Ball Control it would indicate that the game is more focused on the technique rather than the physical aspect).
